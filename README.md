Overview of the Basic Calculator Project
Project Purpose:
The program is a simple, interactive calculator that takes input from the user, performs basic arithmetic operations, and displays the result.
It aims to demonstrate how to handle user input, basic control flow, and arithmetic operations in Python.
Features:
    Operations Supported:
        o	Addition (+)
        o	Subtraction (-)
        o	Multiplication (*)
        o	Division (/)
        
Key Components:
        •	Input Handling: The program collects two numbers and the desired operation from the user.
        •	Processing Logic: Based on the chosen operation, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic calculation.
        •	Error Handling: Prevents invalid operations or inputs, such as division by zero or invalid data types.
        •	Output: Displays the result of the calculation or appropriate error messages.
        
Tools and Technologies:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Built-in Functions: Input/output functions, arithmetic operators, conditional statements, loops, and exception handling.
